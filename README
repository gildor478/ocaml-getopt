What is it ?

The OCaml distribution comes with the module Arg specialized in
command-line parsing. However, it doesn't support the well known
features of GNU getopt and getopt_long.

The module Getopt is an alternative; it supports GNU syntax, but from the
programmer point of view, it is close to the spirit of Arg: the programmer
gives to the general parsing function a list of possible options, together
with the behaviour of these options.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements

I use the releases 3.00 of OCaml (should be OK with older version, except
for the use of the new autolink feature).

General usage information

The documentation is included in the file getopt.mli;
also have a look to sample.ml.

There is no installation.
